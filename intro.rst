The ACEINNA INS2000 is a robust high precision receiver which combines advantages of two different but complementary 
technologies：the absolute accuracy positioning of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and the stability of 
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This product provides an excellent price/performance/size GNSS+INS solution delivering 
a stable and continuously available 3D position, velocity and attitude, even through periods when satellite signals are 
blocked. The GNSS engine of INS2000 supports multiple frequencies from GPS,GLONASS,GALILEO,BDS and QZSS delivers centimeter 
level real-time positioning. The INS2000 integrates a high performance MEMS IMU in a single sealed box as well as various 
ports and connectivity options, which is highly convenient for you to integrate in your own applications. A built-in web 
UI enables fast configuration, graphic information display and convenient firmware upgrade in the field.

INS2000 key features are listed as follows:

* GPS, BDS, GLONASS ,GALILEO,QZSS multi-frequency support
* Centimeter level high precision RTK positioning
* High performance MEMS IMU integrated

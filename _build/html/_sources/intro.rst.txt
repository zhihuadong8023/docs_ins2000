The Aceinna INS2000 Receiver is a highly reliable, highly integrated Beidou high-precision positioning and 
directional inertial navigation combined receiver. Support BDS/GPS/GLONASS three-system RTK 
high-precision positioning. Using independent intellectual property rights of fast carrier phase ambiguity 
resolution technology and multipath suppression algorithms, it can quickly and accurately calculate 
centimeter-level position information; it can receive RTCM data from multiple ground reference stations 
at the same time, and support short, medium and long baseline RTK solutions Count. Built-in high-performance 
MEMS IMU, can achieve up to 200Hz inertial original observation output and stable and reliable position, 
speed, attitude result output. Built-in multi-language Web GUI, can realize zero-handed configuration, 
graphical data display and remote upgrade. It can be widely used in high-precision surveying and mapping, 
mechanical control, displacement and deformation monitoring, precision agriculture, exploration, 
transportation, etc. The receiver also has a convenient and easy-to-use web configuration interface, 
which greatly reduces the threshold of use, and has a rich interface to adapt to various application scenarios.

This instruction manual describes most of the commonly used hardware of the product, and how to use the 
supporting software, as well as other related useful resources.
